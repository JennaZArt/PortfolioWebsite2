                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p style="padding-top:10px">Course: Introduction to Digital Audio <br>Professor: Dr. David Ogborn
                    <br>Voice Actress: Katrina McMullen<br>Equipment: Audio-Technica AT2050, Audio-Technica ATH-M30x,
                    Zoom H4N Pro <br>Software: Reaper, Adobe Illustrator (artwork)</p>
                <h3>The Goal</h3>
                <p>This radio play was inspired by the true story of Sadako Sasaki, a young victim of the 1945 Hiroshima
                    bombing. Sadako is known for folding origami cranes throughout her illness and continues to be
                    remembered today as a symbol of peace. My goal was to convey the suffering the innocent civilian
                    victims of the bombing experienced through audio.
                    <br><br>Technical goals:
                <ul>
                    <li>The piece explores contrasting qualities of the performer’s voice.</li>
                    <li>All audio is carefully positioned both in time and within the auditory scene. </li>
                    <li>Dynamic range should be appropriate for the average listening scenario. </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>The Process</h3>
                <p>Step One: Writing the Script.
                    <br><br>My visit to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum was unforgettable. Reading about the
                    atrocities of nuclear warfare and seeing the multitude of memorabilia representing the pain that
                    extends so far was difficult. One story that affected me deeply was Sadako Sasaki’s. I remembered
                    the details of her story vividly even months later, allowing my script to write itself. I double
                    checked my facts along the way to ensure my fictionalized version of the bombing still maintained
                    historical accuracy and properly portrayed Sasaki’s determination. I also made notations in the
                    script regarding the voice and sound delivery to create a strong auditory experience with
                    contrastive qualities. Once my script was finished, I went to my peers to provide me with feedback
                    and to edit my script.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Step Two: Recording the Audio.
                    <br><br>The vocals were recorded in the surround sound studio at McMaster University. I attended an
                    information session and read the provided help document to familiarize myself with the studio and
                    prepare for my recording session. My session consisted of preparing the equipment and then setting
                    the levels, allowing for 10 dB of headroom, and making sure I was using a sample rate of 48 kHz and
                    a bit depth of 24 bits. I monitored the levels throughout the recording, adjusting accordingly for
                    the quieter and louder moments I outlined in my script. I also explored my neighbourhood equipped
                    with my portable recorder and recorded footsteps and ambient noise that I incorporated to help build
                    the auditory scene.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Step Three: Editing and Mixing.
                    <br><br>I listened through my recordings multiple times and selected the ones I felt were the best
                    vocally. I found additional supporting audio from freesound.org to create stronger auditory scenes.
                    I cut the pieces together, removing any excess breathing and other unnecessary sounds while being
                    mindful of the timing between clips. I wanted the timing to assist in developing drama and emotion.
                    I layered a combination of several found and original recordings to achieve this goal. Once I was
                    happy with the flow of the story, I added EQ filters to improve the sound quality and increase the
                    coherence of the audio, listening through the whole piece multiple times between adjustments.
                    Editing the piece did not come without challenges. I essentially had three characters in my story –
                    young Amaya, older Amaya, and the mother. Unfortunately, I only recorded one voice actress. I
                    planned to make slight pitch adjustments to the vocals to differentiate between characters, however,
                    I soon realized the difficulty in doing this while avoiding substantial distortion. I had to
                    compromise and accept some distortion to ensure the voices were contrastive enough. This project was
                    a fantastic learning experience for me and if I were to do a similar project in the future, I would
                    prioritize finding separate voice actors for each character rather than trying to rely on
                    post-production solutions.

                <h3>Found Sounds</h3>
                <p>All supporting audio was found on freesound.org.
