                <h2>1990s - Minimalism</h2>
                <p style="padding-top:10px; padding-bottom:200px;">Maximalist designs were heavily favoured for decades prior to the 1990s, which eventually lead to a distressing sense of oversaturation within the design community. Designers grew tired of these busy, high-energy designs, and returned to the less-is-more approach typical of modernism. The goal of minimalism was to create meaning with the least amount of forms required to do so. This style took off and still persists to this day thanks to its sophisticated and timeless quality, making it a common style used in branding.
                    <br><br>Minimalism features simple layouts with ample white space, limited colours and clean, legible fonts. Every element should serve a purpose in communicating the message of the design. Deceptively simple, balance, hierarchy, and space all need to be mastered to achieve a successful minimalist design.
