                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p style="padding-top:10px">Organization: Hamilton Health Sciences Foundation
                    <br>Creative concept by: 20Eight Digital Marketing Agency
                    <br>Software: Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro

                </p>
                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>The 50/50 Inspiration Lottery allows individuals to purchase tickets for the chance to win a cash
                    prize while supporting the hospitals associated with Hamilton Health Sciences. To advertise the
                    November 2022 Inspiration Lottery, I created two animated ads. These ads were featured on digital
                    screens in restobars and residential buildings across Hamilton. In addition to these animated ads, I
                    was also responsible for the design of five flights of display ads and Meta ads and headers for
                    emails. This contributed to the November 2022 Inspiration Lottery overachieving the revenue goal by
                    23%, raising $104,750 total.
                </p>
                <h3>The Goal</h3>
                <p>Research has shown that audiences need to view an ad approximately 7 times before they take action to
                    buy. The goal of the digital screen ads was to provide another avenue to reach potential buyers and
                    increase their number of impressions, ultimately hoping to convert impressions to ticket purchases.
                </p>
                <h3>Design</h3>
                <p>20Eight's data from previous lotteries concluded that people respond best to ads with human faces and money. These were the two key images included. The animations were kept minimal and slow-paced to avoid them becoming overwhelming and distracting. The most important text components are static and never leave the screen (the tagline and the call to action), while the less crucial information slides in and changes every few seconds.</p>
