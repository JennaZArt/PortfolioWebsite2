                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p style="padding-top:10px">Course: Graphic Design
                    <br>Professor: Lauren Wickware
                    <br>Software: Adobe InDesign, Adobe Photoshop
                    <br>Equipment: Nikon D5600 
                    <br>Additional Resource: Milanote
                </p>
                <h3>The Goal</h3>
                <p>For this project, I was instructed to redesign a book cover, with the goal of drawing a young adult
                    audience to classic literature.
                    There were three primary objectives:
                <ul>
                    <li>To experience the entire design process from concept to design, developing several iterations
                        and applying feedback before reaching the final product.</li>
                    <li>To apply design principles to visually communicate a concept.</li>
                    <li>To use type to convey meaning.</li>
                </ul>
                Design Goals:<br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Design is inspiring and appropriate for the concept, with a focus on typography.</li>
                    <li>The tone of the design is different to the tone of the original book cover.</li>
                    <li>All elements in the original design are included.</li>
                    <li>Typography is the focus of the design. Other graphic elements are kept to a minimum.</li>
                    <li>The content is legible.</li>
                    <li>Both analogue and digital techniques are used.</li>
                    <li>Design principles including Gestalt principles, scale, framing, and hierarchy are applied.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>The Process</h3>
                <p>Step One: Research.
                    <br><br>I first read the book I selected, <i>The Call of the Wild</i> by Jack London. I took notes on the key aspects of the book, the main character's experiences and personality, and the themes in the book. 
                    The book took place during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush, so I did external research on the real-life event. I also looked into Jack London and his inspirations for writing the book.

                <br>
                <p>Step Two: Mind Map.
                    <br><br>To explore the ideas of the novel and help develop a direction for my design concept, I created a mind map using Milanote. The concept I decided to base my design on was Buck's internal journey from domesticated to feral and his fight to survive in the new, brutal environment.

                <br>
                <p>Step Three: Moodboard.
                    <br><br>To translate the theme from my mind map to visuals, I developed a moodboard. I kept my research on the left so I could refer to it while selecting images to include, ensuring the visuals were in line with the intended tone of the novel and my concept.

                <br>
                <p>Step Four: Cover Sketches
                <br><br>I developed three distinct sketches. I brought these with me to class and received ample feedback from my peers, allowing me to refine my ideas moving forward.  
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>Step Five: The Final Design.
                <br><br>With the feedback from my classmates in mind, I continued experimenting with the design. After much trial and error, I finally arrived at the end result.
                I also created a title page, half title page, and table of contents. 
                </p>
                <p>Design Choices:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Monochromatic blue colour scheme with a pop of red blood to reflect Buck's fight to live. "Call" is in a gold that acts as a complementary colour to the blues. It shows that the motivation for Buck's capture and beginning of his journey was due to the Gold Rush, i.e. the catalyst that "called" him to the wild.</li>
                        <li>The alignment of "The Call of the" creates movement and carries the eye toward "Wild," representing Buck's journey.</li>
                        <li>The typeface I chose was Baskerville. The main characteristic of the typeface is traditional with serifs. I chose a serif font so the serifs can help the eye 'connect' the letters, enforcing the movement created by my alignment techniques. The traditional aspect of Baskerville also serves to represent Buck's domesticated state, which later turns feral, which is shown by the blood splatter on the word "Wild." However, Buck is still Buck on the inside, not the aggressive dog the other characters in the novel judge him to be, which is why I continued to use Baskerville for the word "Wild."</li>
                        <li>My analog element was a photograph I took of the snow in my backyard.</li>
                        <li>The dark blue at the bottom represents the harsh environment that forces Buck to adapt and become feral.</li>
                        <li>The table of contents also operates on the idea of Buck's movement through his journey, consistent with the other design choices above.</li>
                        <li>I used a grid to align all of my elements and create a pleasing and balanced composition.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
