                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p style="padding-top:10px">Course: Design and Code <br>Professor: Dr. David Harris Smith <br>Software: p5.js</p>
                <h3>The Goal</h3>
                <p>The goal of this project was to create a p5.js sketch that generates an interesting aesthetic effect
                    through code.
                    <br><br>Technical goals:
                <ul>
                    <li>All basic programming elements are utilized including variables, conditionals, functions,
                        arrays, and objects.</li>
                    <li>Randomization of the generated effect is intentional and controlled.</li>
                    <li>Code is properly formatted with clear nesting of code blocks.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>The Process</h3>
                <p>Step One: Research.
                    <br><br>Before this project, I had minimal knowledge about generative art. After reading articles
                    about it and researching the works of notable generative artists such as Vera Molnar and Casey Reas,
                    I grew a new appreciation for the art form. One of the defining features of generative art is
                    controlled randomization. It fascinated me how artists skillfully limit randomized variables
                    produced by algorithms to create unique works that can only be achieved by blending the strengths of
                    artists and technology. I wanted to highlight this feature in my project by coding something that is
                    undergoing constant change and producing randomized results while maintaining creative jurisdiction
                    as the artist.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Step Two: Experimentation.
                        <br><br>I began practicing coding techniques I was learning from my tutorials at school and videos online to ensure I could confidently apply these techniques into my project. I started working with simple fundamentals such as variables and conditionals and worked my way up to more complex elements like arrays, classes, functions. Once I developed a thorough understanding of a variety of coding elements, I moved onto creating the project. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p style="padding-bottom:200px">Step Three: Coding.
                        <br><br>My project was built around simple shapes including circles, lines, and rectangles. I used classes to create patterns in a circular structure. As this project was based on aesthetics, I tweaked variables until I felt my code was consistently generating interesting and visually pleasing results. I also incorporated design theory to achieve this by using a monochromatic colour scheme and calculating the size of the shapes using the golden ratio. Nearly every aspect in my project is randomized in some way, resulting in a unique visual being drawn in each draw loop.
