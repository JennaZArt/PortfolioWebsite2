                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p style="padding-top:10px">Course: Design and Code
                    <br>Professor: Dr. David Harris Smith
                    <br>Software: Adobe InDesign, Adobe Illustrator
                </p>

                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>For this project, I was to create an infographic on a topic of my choosing. When a high-profile
                    incident such as a mass shooting occurs, people try to connect the dots and form conclusions,
                    leading to facts being twisted or correlations being
                    misinterpreted. My observation of this phenomenon sparked the idea behind my infographic, and I
                    created it with the goal of dispelling widespread myths surrounding mass shootings and
                    clarifying what the facts really are in a visually engaging way.</p>

                <h3>The Goal</h3>
                <p>The layout of the infographic should be well organized and the topic should be presented in a
                    structure that is appropriate for the content. The text should be concise and the images should
                    successfully visualize and support the text. The elements should be clean and design theory should
                    guide the visual choices.</p>

                <h3>Design</h3>
                <p>Once I completed my research on the topic, I brainstormed ways to organize the information. I started by defining mass shootings, highlighting common
                    misconceptions, focusing on the perpetrators, and finally concluding with a more hopeful section on
                    prevention. Once I laid out my story, I developed sketches of potential icons I could use to visually communicate key terms or data. I then created vector images based on my sketches using
                    Illustrator. I then built these pieces into a vertical layout. 
                    <br><br> 
                    I chose a complementary colour palette consisting of blue and orange to maximize contrast and allow the
                    key words in the text pop. The sizing of the elements including the text and images was determined using the golden ratio
                    to create a balanced visual hierarchy. The section about the perpetrators is designed to resemble a school, one of the most common targets for mass
                    shootings. The line created by the bullet guides the eye through the building. The myths are all marked by a shattered glass effect consistent with the typography of the title. I chose to make the background a gradient that gradually lightens to
                    reflect the decision to end the infographic with the prevention section.
