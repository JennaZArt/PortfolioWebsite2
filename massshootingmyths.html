                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p style="padding-top:10px">Course: Design and Code
                    <br>Professor: Dr. David Harris Smith
                    <br>Software: Adobe InDesign, Adobe Illustrator
                </p>
                <h3>The Goal</h3>
                <p>When a high-profile incident such as a mass shooting occurs, people naturally try to connect the dots
                    and form conclusions. This can result in facts being twisted or misguided correlations being
                    perpetuated. The main goal was to dispel these widespread myths surrounding mass shootings and to
                    clarify what the facts really are in a visually engaging way.
                    <br><br>Design Goals:
                <ul>
                    <li>Layout is well organized and the topic is presented in a sensible structure.</li>
                    <li>Elements are simple and clean.</li>
                    <li>Text is concise. Images successfully visualize and support the text.</li>
                    <li>Design theory guides visual decisions.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>The Process</h3>
                <p>Step One: Research.
                    <br><br>I began by consulting a variety of resources viewing the issue from multiple perspectives to
                    build an accurate picture of the facts. I initially planned to cover the topic of mass shootings
                    more broadly with a focus on the United States.
                    However, what I discovered during the research process was that proven information is scarce and
                    reserving my research to the United States added another constraint. Despite
                    how common they may seem, mass shootings occur <i>very</i> rarely, so limited resources are
                    allocated toward conducting studies on the topic. I worked around this by narrowing down my idea to
                    focus on myths with a closing section on prevention. I knew I had an adequate amount of information
                    to successfully build the infographic around that.

                <p style="font-size: 0.75em">Research.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Step Two: Brainstorming and Image Creation.
                    <br><br>Once I had completed my research, I brainstormed ways to visualize the information. This
                    involved discussions with my peers and professor/teacher's assistants and quick sketches of
                    potential icons I could
                    combine with key words. I then created vector images based on my sketches using Adobe Illustrator.

                <p style="font-size: 0.75em">Brainstorming Sketches.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Step Three: Layout Design.
                    <br><br>I experimented with the layout in Adobe InDesign and, after receiving feedback from others,
                    I decided the simple vertical layout was the most balanced and suitable for my content.

                <br>
                <p>Design Choices:
                <ul style="padding-bottom:200px">
                    <li>I chose a complementary colour palette consisting of blue and orange to maximize contrast so the
                        key words in the text pop.</li>
                    <li>The sizing of the elements including the text and images was determined using the golden ratio
                        to create a balanced visual hierarchy.</li>
                    <li>The section about the perpetrators is designed to resemble a school, a common target for mass
                        shootings. The line created by the bullet guides the eye through the building.</li>
                    <li>It is true that mass shootings are often unpredictable, but there are steps we can take to
                        reduce the frequency. I chose to make the background a gradient that gradually lightens to
                        reflect the decision to end the infographic with a hopeful section on prevention.</li>
                </ul>
